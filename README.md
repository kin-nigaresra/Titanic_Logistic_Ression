# Titanic_Logisctic_Ression
In this study i want to present Logistic Regression Model.
I used titanic dataset which is a known,
Let's estimate the probability of people surviving given their characteristics.
The data set consists of 768 observations and 12 variables.
Dependet variable is 'Survived'
1 person to survive, 0 indicates the death of the person.
# Variables:
Survived
Pclass 
Age 
Sibsp
Sex 
Embarked
Fare 
Cabin
Let's develop  survival model with data pre-processing and feature engineering
